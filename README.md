# AIImageGenerator

## Summary of the Project
The goal of the "AI Image Generator" project is to display a logo on a splash screen for 3 seconds. Afterward, on the subsequent screen, there is a search bar where users can perform searches. Entering search keywords displays images related to the input, and clicking on an image directs users to a detail page where they can view the selected image in a larger size.
